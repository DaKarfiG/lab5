Somehow linked the remote to the classroom and couldnt push my own changes when submitting when I tried to submit, hope all files are correctly there.
Submitted zip because I get an error message that my project is using AGP 8.7.0 and my latest supported version is 8.6.0 on my software that im using, I believe it is causing me to be unable to build an APK because when I go through the process it doesn't build an APK, I have everything working regarding APK creation, but something happened after I forked this project off GitHub and is causing a ruckus, and its already past the due date so I decided to just submit the zip.
